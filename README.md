Hello and welcome to my Pokemon rolodex app.

This app utilizes an API that retrieves data from a pokemon character database.

Click on the names and a modal(window) will pop up displaying some information and an image of the selected pokemon. 

Must be using a browser that supports jQuery, Popper, and Javascrip.

Enjoy!
